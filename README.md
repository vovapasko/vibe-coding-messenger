# 📨 Vibe coding messenger (MVP)

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a real-time messaging platform built with **React (frontend)** and **Kotlin (backend)**. It allows authenticated users to send and receive messages instantly. The goal is to create a clean, interactive MVP that can be expanded later with advanced security and messaging features. Partner in crime: GPT-4.1

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Kotlin (Ktor preferred, Spring Boot optional)
- **Communication**: WebSocket (real-time messaging)
- **Optional**: Docker, Material UI or Tailwind for styling
